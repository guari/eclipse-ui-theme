Moonrise arrived on Eclipse Marketplace in January 2014 and is now [TOP12 plugin](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/metrics/successful_installs/last30days). See also lightweitght [Maven](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/maven) plugin that just arrived.

Requirements
------------

* Eclipse 4.2+

Installation
------------

* #### Manual:
Download [moonrise_0.8.8.jar](https://github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme/blob/master/com.github.eclipseuitheme.themes.plugin/bin/com.github.eclipseuitheme.moonrise_0.8.8.jar?raw=true) package and put it into your Eclipse ```\dropins\plugins\``` folder;

* #### Update site:
Or download this plugin by using ```Help > Install New Software...``` and add the update site:
<pre>https://raw.github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme/master/com.github.eclipseuitheme.themes.updatesite</pre>

* #### Eclipse Marketplace:
<table style="border: none;">
  <tbody>
    <tr style="border:none;">
      <td style="vertical-align: middle; padding-top: 10px; border: none;">
        <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=1403812" title="Drag and drop into a running Eclipse Indigo workspace to install Eclipse Moonrise UI Theme">
          <img src="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/modules/custom/marketplace/images/installbutton.png"/>

  </tbody>
</table>

* Restart Eclipse and go to ```Window > Preferences > General > Appearance```;

* Select *MoonRise (standalone)* or, for a little better tabs decoration, install *Eclipse 4 Chrome Theme* from marketplace or from [here](https://github.com/jeeeyul/eclipse-themes) and select *MoonRise*;

### Syntax highlighting scheme (optional):

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme/master/com.github.eclipseuitheme.themes.plugin/screenshot/sources_syntax_colors.png)

You can find the one used in the screenshot below:

**WARNING:** Take a backup of your preferences before importing so you can safely restore them if you need (```File > Export...``` then select ```General > Preferences```);

* [RainbowDrops.epf](https://github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme/blob/master/com.github.eclipseuitheme.themes.plugin/bin/color-scheme/RainbowDrops.epf?raw=true) (most accurate, download by right-clicking the link and selecting ```Save link as...``` then import it with Eclipse built-in Preferences import: ```File > Import...``` then select ```General > Preferences```);

* or [RainbowDrops.xml](https://github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme/blob/master/com.github.eclipseuitheme.themes.plugin/bin/color-scheme/RainbowDrops.xml?raw=true) (download by right-clicking the link and selecting ```Save link as...``` then import it with [Eclipse Color Theme Plugin](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=plugin));

* or [here](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=20025);

**NOTE:** Syntax highlighting settings and UI theme are separated, you can import your own scheme or customize it in Eclipse Preferences if you like.

### Fine-tuning:

There are some settings that can be changed only from the Eclipse Preferences window and that override the theme's settings by default:

* ##### Change the colors for Content Assist:
Go to ```Window > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts``` then change the colors for ```Basic > Content Assist background color``` and ```Basic > Content Assist foreground color```
(eg. *foreground color: #DDD*, *background color: #333*);

* ##### Change the colors for Console:
Go to ```Window > Preferences > Run/Debug > Console``` and modify the colors as you like
(eg. *Standard Out text color: #DDD*, *Background color: #333*);

* ##### Change the colors for Javadoc:
Go to ```Window > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts``` then change the colors for ```Java > Javadoc view background```.
Note that the foreground color cannot be changed and depends on system font color.

### Trouble-shooting:

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| The font of the title of the tabs is different | Ensure that on your machine is installed ```Segoe Print``` font then open the downloaded jar package with an archive explorer, open ```/themes/css/moonrise-ui-standalone.css```, search for any occurrencies of ```font-family``` property and change its value to ```Segoe Print``` (or what ever you prefer), then save/update the jar archive. |
| The size of the title of the tabs is different | Eclipse does not scale it with a DPI-Aware policy. Open the downloaded jar package with an archive explorer, open ```/themes/css/moonrise-ui-standalone.css```, search for ```font-size``` property and modify its value according to your needs then save the file. |
| The label of the checkboxes has a color difficult to read | It's related to a SWT bug, use a system theme that has lighter font color for buttons. |
| The text of the buttons has a color difficult to read (MAC-OSX) | It's related to a SWT bug, try [this](https://github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme/blob/master/com.github.eclipseuitheme.themes/bin/com.github.eclipseuitheme.moonrise_0.8.3_OSX.jar?raw=true) 'patched' version if you have this issue (no more needed for v0.8.4+). |
| After updating the plugin, it isn't loaded as expected | Eclipse seems to use some sorts of internal resources caching that don't work always very well. To ensure that it's not an issue related to the new plugin version, create a new workspace and import your projects here, or try with a freshly downloaded Eclipse release |

### Notes:

Currently this theme uses the CSS-SWT engine introduced in the 4.2 version of the Eclipse Platform and should provide a dark style for each GUI widget that can be handled with the last version of the Eclipse SDK.
This plugin has been tested with the main Eclipse Development Tool packages on Linux distributions, Windows and OSX and with the following Eclipse releases:

* Luna (4.4)
* Kepler (4.3)
* Juno (4.2.x)

It works best with a dark system theme since currently the look of some GUI widgets cannot be overriden directly in Eclipse. The more noticeable issues related to SWT are the `ScrollBar` widgets, the `Table` headers/lines and the arrows to fold/unfold contents that cannot be styled. As minor issues there are `Button` background color on Windows and OSX that cannot be customized (on Windows checkboxes/radio controls do not inherit font color) and some other little bugs related to the CSS engine that makes the customizations harder and unwieldy.
Aside from that, the theme currently might not look perfect on each platform, but should be fully useable on all of them. The Eclipse CSS engine is still under improvement.

Debugging and improvements
--------------------------

A fork of this plugin has been merged with the main Eclipse platform, you should find it pre-installed in the future Eclipse builds. If you want to contribute to its development you can send me a pull request on this repository or commits a patch to the main Eclipse [repository](http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes).
If you found an issue linked to this plugin but that is related to the Eclipse/SWT engine you can report it to [Bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?component=UI&product=Platform&resolution=---) then add a link of it to this README by sending a pull request. The following Eclipse bugs are affecting this plugin, you can vote for it to gain more visibility from Eclipse platform developers:
* *Solved* [Bug 423744 - Importing a local resource throws a MalformedURLException](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=423744);
* *Solved* [Bug 419016 - Provide some reasonable bridge interactions between CSS and our older Colors and Fonts properties](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419016);
* [Bug 425646 - Support for black and inverted color UI themes](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425646);
* [Bug 419482 - Cascading policy used to apply rules is broken](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419482);
* [Bug 396780 - CTabRendering doesn't draw bottom tabs correctly](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=396780);
* [Bug 384906 - Allow styling of table headers via CSS](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=384906);
* [Bug 264531 - Provide css styling for SWT menu bar](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=264531);
* [Bug 401015 - Add support for styling hyperlinks in Links](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=401015);
* [Bug 419377 - Setting a property to 'inherit' fires an IllegalStateException](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419377);

Use *CSS Spy* to inspect widgets properties and *CSS Scratchpad* or *Lightweight CSS Editor* to apply a quick customization. To test what elements can be modified or not with CSS, drop a line like this one: `* { background-color:red; color:white; }` into *CSS Scratchpad* (restart Eclipse to reset the theme).

## Build and Release
